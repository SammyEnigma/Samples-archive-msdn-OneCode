<h1></h1>
<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
<p><em>This sample application is created to demonstrate Single Document Interface(SDI) with multiple views in MFC.</em></p>
<h1><strong><span style="font-size:20px">Description</span></strong></h1>
<p><em style="font-size:10px">This is a MFC SDI application and it has three views as follows</em></p>
<p><em>1. Main View - Displays plain text</em></p>
<p><em>2.</em><em style="font-size:10px">Form View - Contains a form with different controls editbox, combobox</em></p>
<p><em>3.</em><em style="font-size:10px">Edit View - User can enter text on the client area</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size:10px">&nbsp;</em><em style="font-size:10px">In the toolbar there is a combobox with these three view options. By default 'Main View' is selected.</em></p>
<p><em style="font-size:10px">This combobox is used to control the view display. The selected view(in combobox) will get displayed on the client area of the main frame window.By default the application loaded with 'Main View'.
</em></p>

 and reduce developers' efforts in solving typical programming tasks. Our team listens to developers&rsquo; pains in the MSDN forums, social media and various DEV communities. We write code samples based on developers&rsquo; frequently asked programming tasks,
 and allow developers to download them with a short sample publishing cycle. Additionally, we offer a free code sample request service. It is a proactive way for our developer community to obtain code samples directly from Microsoft.</p>
