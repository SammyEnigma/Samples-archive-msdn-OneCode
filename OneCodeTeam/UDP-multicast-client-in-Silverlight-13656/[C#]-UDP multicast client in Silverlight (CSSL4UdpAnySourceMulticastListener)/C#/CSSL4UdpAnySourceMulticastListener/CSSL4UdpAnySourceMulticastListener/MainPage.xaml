            This sample demonstrates the use of the UdpAnySourceMulticastClient, sharing messages between as many clients as may broadcast on the same port (8888 in this case).  
            Open multiple instances of the web page from any machines on a network supporting multicast (or locally on a single machine) to try it out.
            In order for multicast to work from Silverlight, there must exist a MulticastPolicyServer on the network.  
            Each message is identified by its client's session ID associated with the web site from where the Silverlight application was loaded.            
            This sample exposes a simple console application, which runs when it is debugged, to expose such a server.  
            The code for this server is available as part of the Silverlight SDK, here included as a single binary referenced in the console application.
