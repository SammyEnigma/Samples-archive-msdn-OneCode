This sample demonstrates how to implement deep clone between objects in C# 
using reflection. 
We can use the MemberwiseClone to get a copy, but the MemberwiseClone method 
creates a shallow copy by creating a new object, and then copying the non-static 
fields of the current object to the new object. If a field is a value type, a   
bit-by-bit copy of the field is performed. If a field is a reference type, the  
reference is copied but the referred object is not. 
In this sample, we make use metadata information to clone a new object and drill 
down each field, ultimately, copy this field.
