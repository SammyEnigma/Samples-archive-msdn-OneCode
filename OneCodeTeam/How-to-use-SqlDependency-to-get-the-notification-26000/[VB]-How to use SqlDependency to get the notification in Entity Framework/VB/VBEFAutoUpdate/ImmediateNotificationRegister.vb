' We can use the Sqldependency to get the notification when the data is changed 
' in database, but EF doesn’t have the same feature. In this sample, we will 
' demonstrate how to automatically update by Sqldependency in Entity Framework.
' In this sample, we will demonstrate two ways that use SqlDependency to get the

' We can get the notification immediately by this class when the data changed.
